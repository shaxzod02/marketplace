# npm resolution error report

While resolving: client@0.1.0
Found: react@19.0.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0" from react-no-ssr@1.1.0
node_modules/react-no-ssr
  react-no-ssr@"^1.1.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
